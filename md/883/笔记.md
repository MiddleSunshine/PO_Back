1. We use the present simple to talk about things in general.We use it to say that something happens all the time or repeatedly,or that something is true in general.

我们用present simple指代一些事情经常发生，或者大部分情况下是真的，类似常识之类的东西吧。

> The earth goes round the sun.

2. We use **do/dose** to make questions and negative sentences:

> where do you come from ?

> I do not smoke.

3. We use present simple to say how often we do things.

> How often do you go to the hospital?

4. Sometimes we do things by saying something.

有时候我们想说一些什么的时候，比如：

- I promise
- I suggest
- I advise
- I agree
- I refuse
