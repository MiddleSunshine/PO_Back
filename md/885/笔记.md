1. We use continuous forms (I'm waiting,it's raining etc) for actions and happenings that have started but not finished.
Some verbs are not normal used in this way.We don't say 'I'm knowing','they are liking'.We say 'I know','they like'.

The following verbs are not normally used in the present continuous.

- like
- want
- need
- prefer
- know
- realise
- understand
- recognize
- believe
- suppose
- remember
- mean
- belong
- fit
- confirm
- consist
- seem

2. **think**

When think means 'believe' or 'have an option',we do not use the continuous.

> I think Mary is Canadian,but I'm not sure.
> What do you think of my idea?

When think means 'consider', the continuous is possible.

> I'm thinking about what happened.I often think about it.

3. **see,hear,smell,taste,look,feel**

We normally use the present simple with see/hear/smell/taste/look/feel.

> Do you see that man over there?

You can use the present simple or continuous to say somebody **looks** or **feels** now:

> You look well today.
> You are looking well today.

> How do you feel now?
> How are you feeling now?



4. **am/is/are being**

You can say **he is being.....,you are being** etc to say how somebody is behaving now.

> I don't understand why he is being so selffish.

We use **am/is/are being** to say how a person is behaving (=doing something they can control) now.

> Why are you being so unreasonable about this thing?
